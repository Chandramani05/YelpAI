# Purpose 

YelpAI is an intelligent chatbot designed to simplify the process of finding the perfect restaurant. It looks at what kind of food you like and where you are, then finds the best places on Yelp. The best part? It can also answer questions about those restaurants by reading their reviews. So, instead of spending lots of time reading reviews yourself, YelpAI does the work for you! Our goal is to make finding and learning about restaurants quick and easy, so you can spend less time searching and more time enjoying delicious meals.

### YelpAI Tool Stack

YelpAI is built using a combination of powerful tools:

- **Yelp Fusion API**: This API provides access to a wealth of data related to businesses, allowing YelpAI to gather information about the restaurants it recommends.

- **OpenAI API**: OpenAI's language model, GPT-4, is at the core of YelpAI's chatbot functionality. It processes and analyzes text data to provide insightful responses to user queries.

- **LangChain**: LangChain acts as a bridge between Yelp Fusion and OpenAI API. It prepares and formats the retrieved data from Yelp Fusion to be fed into the OpenAI language model.

Together, these tools enable YelpAI to deliver efficient restaurant recommendations and answer user queries effectively.
